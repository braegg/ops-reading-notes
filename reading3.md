What is the BIOS?
The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is a system utility program that supports the CPU in locating and loading up the operating system into memory so that the PC is ready to be used by the user. It also tests some hardware to make sure it’s located and fully functional. 


Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
The BIOS is similar to a checklist before take-off where the CPU is the engine. Before the pilot can take off and fly the plane they need to go through a series of steps of a checklist to make sure the plane is fully operational and won't crash. Similarly, a BIOS is a checklist to make sure the computer is fully operational and ready to go when the CPU starts up and loads up for the user to operate it safely.  


What is the “Power On Self Test”?

This is the hardware checklist part of the BIOS to make sure all the essential hardware components are operational. 


What is the CMOS?

The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) is a physical semiconductor installed on the motherboard. This is where all the booting process information is stored.



What is the CMOS battery?

This powers the CMOS while the PC is shutdown so the information configured through the CMOS utility is not lost during PC shotown and is easily accessed during the booting process. 

## Things I want to know more about
What other components use CMOS and how are they used?
