1. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

	If you should come acroess multiple issues that are happening simultaneously you should break them down and troubleshoot them individually. With experience, you will find which you should troubleshoot first and the solution to that problem may directly resolve other issues. 

2. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

	Once you have identified the solution, then it's time to implement it. This may be done right away or at a scheduled time that doesn't interfere with operations. 

3. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

	Documenting the entire troubleshooting process helps you keep track of it during the process and archive it for later reference. This makes it easier for future techs who come across the same or similar issue to find a solution quicker. 

4. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

	PC issues are the most common in my area and there's 1000's of ways that things can go wrong. The same problem can have dozens of solutions depending on the situation. The CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology is the perfect blueprint to find the solution to the various problems you come across. Starting simple and working your way up to find the solution to the exact problem the user is having.
