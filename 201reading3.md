1. What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly about customers?

	Help desk professionals provide front-line support between an organization and end users. They are able to fix a problem or diagnose it to the point that it can be escalated to the right department to resolve. 

2. The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?

	Hard and soft skills are essential in everyday life. Soft skills are more important in the community. Knowing how to communicate with others properly helps bridge the gap between hard skills. Computer techs have the hard skills to resolve computer issues but need a mechanic when their car breaks down. Using soft skills to communicate with the mechanic on the issue will help the mechanic better diagnose the problem. Telling a mechanic, "Car broke, fix," is not as effective as using your skills to describe the problem as best as you can and use active listening skills to answer any question the mechanic might have properly. 

3. Why have security skills become more critical in recent years for help desk technicians?

 	Security exploits, such as malware, have become more prevalent in security breaches within an organization. Phishing emails have been the most effective way of spreading malware. Properly trained help desk techs can provide instruction and information to end users to prevent such attacks. 

4. How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?

	"Document, document, document" or "Notate, notate, notate" is ingrained in every support professional's brain. It is highly critical that things are documented so that others can review the information to help them in similar cases or during an escalation. Using proper grammar and providing detailed explanations will make it easier for others to review. Critical Thinking is vital to resolving issues. Knowing how to troubleshoot and what questions to ask is important in diagnosing and fixing the problem.
