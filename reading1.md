### Reading #1

In todays topic we discussed the internals of the computer. Reading about the Chinese hack being done utilizing hardware gives me insight on an unconditional form of hacking that will help me prepare for my Cyber Security Career. 

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?

A hardware hack utilizes hardware installed in the equipment as a conduit for the hack. A software hack utilizes software either through existing programs, manipulating someone to install malicious software, or socially engineering them into giving the hacker key information to gain access to the software. 

2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?

Interdiction is one way of altering a computer's hardware. It is done by manipulating devices as they are en route from one place to another. 
The other way is through seeding, which involves manipulating the hardware at the beginning of the manufacturing process.

3. Explain how the hack worked.

The hack worked by implanting inconspicuous chips on the motherboard during the manufacturing in China en route to Supermicro in San Jose to be installed in custom servers individually catered to US customers. The chips were disguised to look like signal conductors to make it harder for them to be detected as microchips without specialized equipment. The chips communicated with anonymous computers connected to the internet as well as preparing the infected PC to accept code generators from the anonymous computers. 

4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

The US utilized their spies to shift through communication intercepts and informants to discover the origin of where the motherboards were manufactured after tracing the serial numbers on the motherboards.
