In today's topic, we discussed the internals of the computer. Reading about the Chinese hack being done utilizing hardware gives me insight on an unconditional form of hacking that will help me prepare for my Cyber Security Career. 

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?

A hardware hack utilizes hardware installed in the equipment as a conduit for the hack. A software hack utilizes software either through existing programs, manipulating someone to install malicious software, or socially engineering them into giving the hacker key information to gain access to the software. 

2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?

Interdiction is one way of altering a computer's hardware. It is done by manipulating devices as they are en route from one place to another. 
The other way is through seeding, which involves manipulating the hardware at the beginning of the manufacturing process.

3. Explain how the hack worked.

The hack worked by implanting inconspicuous chips on the motherboard during the manufacturing in China en route to Supermicro in San Jose to be installed in custom servers individually catered to US customers. The chips were disguised to look like signal conductors to make it harder for them to be detected as microchips without specialized equipment. The chips communicated with anonymous computers connected to the internet as well as preparing the infected PC to accept code generators from the anonymous computers. 

4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

The US utilized their spies to shift through communication intercepts and informants to discover the origin of where the motherboards were manufactured after tracing the serial numbers on the motherboards.

PC basics is the foundation anyone in IT should learn. It's important to know the parts of a computers, how to put them together and how they work. 

1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
	
  More cores are better than higher speeds, as most applications can utilize multiple cores to increase performance. Six cores is the standard, but some high-end games can utilize 8 cores. It’s important to note that a computer doesn’t need more than 6, but performance would dwindle with less than 6 on any modern software program. 


2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?

  You want to make sure the motherboard is the right socket for your CPU. You’re also looking for components built into the motherboard that you use. Some of these would include Bluetooth and Wifi. Also, make sure you find a motherboard with USB ports that you’ll be using. Currently finding a motherboard with USB 2.0, 3.1 and 3.2 will work. Mid-High and above motherboards now include Type C Thunderbolt which will help future-proof your PC.  

3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?

  There is no reason to buy a standard HDD anymore unless you’re looking for cheap bulk storage for media. SSDs have come down drastically in price over the years to the point that cost savings vs performance is null when it comes to HDD vs SSD. The decision now is between SSD and NVMe. SSDs work great for storage as well as background processes. They make for great boot drives. NVMe is your application drive. This is where you want to make sure you store your games and applications. However, an SSD would be sufficient for most applications and games except for high-end gaming and applications that tax heavily on a PC like 3D modeling. 


4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?

  My background is in IT, so this would be relatively easy to explain. However, they would be more confused about why I was even trying to explain the key parts in the first place. My girlfriend is not tech-savvy, although she is extremely smart. In layman's terms, I would explain to her that the CPU is the brain of the operation, while the memory allows you to do more things at once. The hard drive is the computer's closet, where you store all your stuff.

How will Quantum Computing change the hardware of a PC in the future? Will there even be hardware PC's or a terminal connection to a cloud based quantum computer?\
Should building a PC be standard teaching in schools like shopclass and homemaking once was? Or should it be an extracircular activity like shopclass and homemaking are in some schools?
