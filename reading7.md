SSH Protocol

1. What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?

   SSH is a method for sure remote login from one PC to another providing strong authentication. It protected communications securiety and integrity with strong encryption. It provides a secure connection alternative to non-protected login protocols such as 'telnet' and
insecure file transfer methods such as FTP. 

3. What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?

   Typically, SSH is used in corporate environments for secure access for users and automated processes, interactive and automated file transfers, issuing remote commands, and managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components. 

5. How does the SSH protocol work?

   The SSH client connects to the SSH server. The client uses public key cryptography to verify with the server. After the connection is established, the protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashtag algorithms to ensure privacy and integrity of the data being exchanged.
   
7. How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?

   SSH uses various methods to keep data safe and encrypted during communication between the client and the server. These methods include strong encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and SHA-2 (Standard Hashing Algorithm) that ensure the integrity of transmitted data. 
    
9. What is SFTP?

   SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol and runs over SSH. It is likely the most widely used secure file transfer protocol.

What is RDP? And how to use it

1. What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?

   "The Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool gives users the ability to connect to a remote Windows or server over the internet or on a local network, giving them full access to the tools and software installed on it."(2)
   
3. What is RDP?

   "The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to see and use windows on a device in another location"(2)
    
4. What is the RDP port number?

    3389
