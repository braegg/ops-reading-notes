Prompt: 
List the top 3 ways to effectively balance my time between work and university. 

Output:
Create a detailed schedule: Combine all your work commitments, classes, study time, and personal activities into one comprehensive schedule. Use a calendar app or a physical planner to visualize your time and avoid double-booking. Allocate specific time slots for each task, ensuring you have enough time for both work and study. Be sure to schedule breaks and downtime to avoid burnout.

Prioritize and set realistic goals: Identify your most important tasks and prioritize them accordingly. Focus on completing high-priority assignments first and break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Set achievable goals for each day or week, considering both your work and academic responsibilities. Avoid overcommitting yourself and be willing to adjust your schedule as needed.

Utilize time management techniques: Employ effective time management strategies to maximize your productivity. Techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks) or timeboxing (allocating a fixed amount of time to a specific task) can help you stay on track and avoid distractions. Additionally, make the most of your commute or downtime by reviewing notes or listening to recorded lectures.
